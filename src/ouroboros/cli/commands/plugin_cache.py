"""Staged refresh of URL-backed plugin source caches.

Both URL entry points (``ooo plugin add <repo-url>`` and
``ooo plugin install <name> --from <repo-url>``) cache their clone under
``cache_root/<sanitized-host-path>``. They used to delete that directory
before attempting the replacement clone, so a transient clone failure
destroyed the last-known-good cache (#1826). The refresh here clones into
a staging sibling and promotes it over the live cache only after the clone
has fully succeeded, mirroring the atomic-swap discipline the plugin_home
installs already follow.
