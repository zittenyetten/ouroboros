"""`ooo plugin` command group.

UserLevel plugin manager CLI. Implements Q00/ouroboros#731 (locked spec).

Read-only subcommands: `discover`, `inspect`, `list`.
State-mutating subcommands: `add`, `install`, `trust`, `disable`, `remove`.

Anti-patterns explicitly rejected:
  - subdirectory-leaking install strings such as
    `git+https://.../foo.git#plugins/<name>` — these couple the install
    URL to internal repo layout and are forbidden by the locked spec.

    """Persistent record of catalogs the user has interacted with.

    Per the locked RFC ("How sources enter the known catalog"), v0 has
    exactly two registration paths:

    - ``plugin_home`` sources are registered by ``ooo plugin add <repo>``.
      The repo URL becomes a known catalog at that moment, regardless of
      whether the user proceeds to install anything from the selection
      prompt. Subsequent ``install``s can address that ``name`` without
      re-fetching.
    - ``local_path`` sources are registered the first time the user runs
      ``ooo plugin install <name> --from <local-path>`` against an
      absolute path.

    The registry stores one entry per ``(source_type, source_identity)``
    keying directly on the canonical identity, so reinstalls from the
    same source are idempotent.
