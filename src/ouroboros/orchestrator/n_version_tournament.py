"""N-version tournament scaffolding (PR-X X3, opt-in, NOT live-wired).

The idea: an AC that has already burned its one cross-harness redispatch (X1) and
failed *again* can, when ``execution.n_version_tournament`` is on, be dispatched
to up to two additional distinct runtimes **in parallel**, each in its own
isolated git worktree of the run workspace. First result whose verification
passes wins; loser worktrees are discarded; the winner's changes are applied back
to the main workspace.

Status — deliberately scaffolding, not a live trigger. This module ships the
mechanically-testable primitives as pure functions plus a worktree manager:

* :func:`plan_tournament` — pick up to N distinct alternative runtimes (pure).
* :class:`RunWorktreeManager` — create/cleanup *isolated* git worktrees so no
  contestant ever shares a dirty workspace.
* :func:`select_tournament_winner` — first contestant whose verification passed
  wins, deterministically (pure).
* :func:`export_worktree_diff` / :func:`apply_diff_to_workspace` — the simplest
  robust winner-apply mechanism: capture the winner worktree's
  ``git diff --binary`` and ``git apply`` it onto the main workspace. Uses
  ``--binary`` for full binary content transfer, ``-z`` for NUL-safe untracked
  file listing, ``--`` before pathnames, and rejects rc=1 with no patch. A
  failed export is reported as ``None`` (distinct from an empty ``""`` diff) so
  a git error can never be mistaken for "the winner changed nothing".

Wiring the live per-AC trigger into ``parallel_executor`` is intentionally left
out: it is deeply entangled with the executor's per-AC dispatch internals and the
concurrently-edited retry area, and cannot be exercised safely without real
runtimes. Shipping the tested primitives here — and stopping short of the live
trigger — is the honest split (see PR-X X3 guidance).
